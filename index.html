            <p class="hero-bio" style="text-align:justify;">
                I hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Engineering from Anna University, and I recently completed an MSc in Media and Communications (Data & Society) at the London School of Economics with Distinction. I currently work as a Data & Analytics Graduate (Experimentation Analyst) at Sky in London. Across my academic and industry work, I’m interested in studying how commercial AI systems shape people’s privacy, behaviour, perceptions, and trust.

                    Trained a model to turn text prompts into Khan Academy-style educational videos using a novel multimodal
                    architecture. Developed a workflow in which a model translates problem descriptions into animation scripts and
                    corresponding narration, using a synthetic data pipeline and automated quality checks to ensure that
                    visualizations and verbal explanations remain aligned and error-free. Used this curated synthetic dataset to
                    train the model through SFT and DPO, improving the reliability of both code generation and explanatory narration.

                    A qualitative study of how recent graduates in the UK navigate algorithmic hiring platforms such as LinkedIn 
                    and applicant tracking systems (ATS). Using reflexive thematic analysis of in-depth interviews, I examine how 
                    they understand these systems, try to “win” them, and negotiate the privacy and emotional costs involved.

                        Worked as a Research Assistant under the LSE Changemakers scheme, investigating students’ use of generative AI 
                        in learning. Designed and conducted surveys and focus groups to explore how students used GenAI for tasks such as 
                        summarizing, drafting, and explaining concepts, and how concerns about privacy and university monitoring 
                        influenced their behaviour. Conducted mixed-methods analysis, combining qualitative coding with basic statistical 
                        analysis, to identify patterns in students’ trust, perceived risks, and “folk theories” of GenAI tools.

              overview: `Graduates don’t experience AI and ATS as neutral back-end tools. They build informal theories of how these systems work and then write for them.

They distinguish between “acceptable” and “too intimate” data and experiment with small CV tweaks that blur the line between strategic framing and dishonesty.`,
